# Face Generation - Description

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, I was able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; my generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
