# Face Generation (UDACITY) - Description

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible! The project will be broken down into several tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, I was able to visualize the results of my trained Generator to see how it performs. My generated samples provide quite realistic faces with some noise based on number of epochs chosen.
